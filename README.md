# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification-of-CIFAR-10-Dataset
ÙŽUsed Tensorflow Keras to develop a Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification of CIFAR-10 dataset. Some features of the network model such as the optimizer, activation function, number of convolutions in each layer are closely examined in this notebook.
